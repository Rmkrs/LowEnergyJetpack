# LowEnergyJetpack
Low Energy Jetpack mod for the game SpaceEngineers

This is the source code of: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=932510886

This mod turns off Hydrogen storage and usage thereof for the personal JetPack.
The game will instead start using energy for the JetPack, but the mod also sets the drain to a very, very, VERY low amount.
So in fact it almost becomes creative flying.

I created the mod for usage on our dedicated server, but decided to share it here in case anyone else is in need for it.

Many thanks to WeekendMonsters for creating the logo/thumbnail for the mod.

Fly safe.

Huron.
